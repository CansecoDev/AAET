-----------------------------------------------------------[     USAGE    ]----

 * Drag and drop either a single audio file, or a directory containing multiple
   audio files to AAET, then it will ask for the encoding category, which can
   be either ui, 3d or mx. Finally it will produce files with this names at the
   same directory they were originally located:

   {original file/s}_CONVERTED.{EXT}

 * You can also use the command line like this:

     > AAET {input} {format} [output] [--no-suffix]

   - input determines the input path, it must be either an audio file or a
     directory containing audio files, determining the output automatically
     disables the "Press any key to exit" message.

   - format determines the encoding category:
     ui to encode the audio for SFX that plays at UI level.
     3d to encode the audio for SFX that plays on the 3D world.
     mx to encode the audio for Music.

   - output determines the output path, defaulting to the same as the input.

   - --no-suffix will make it not add the _CONVERTED suffix to the files, this
     is only functional if determining the output directory.
